        <div class="subheading mb-5">Biology 🧬</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello my name is Anahi Rubio and I am currently a freshman majoring in biology at the University of California, Riverside. I am a riverside local and decided to attend UCR because it was close to home and had my major available. However, the atmosphere of the school is what really drove me to choose the school despite all the other options that were available. When I stepped foot on campus, I instantly felt at home and the people there were really caring and nice. I chose the biology major because I am passionate about learning about life and how living organisms work. When I was a freshman in high school, I took my very first biology class and instantly fell in love with the topic. That's why ever since I was in my freshman year of high school, I knew that I wanted to pursue my education in biology. From there, I went on to take an additional biology class in high school. My concentration for biology is biology about the human body. This is because I enjoy learning about how the human body systems function and how our bodies are able to process so much complicated information.<br><br>

        After my bachelors in biology, I plan to further my education by attending graduate school in hope of becoming a physician assistant. The reason I will be choosing PA instead of MD is because I want to have a better work-life balance that I won't be able to have as an MD. The PA job market is currently growing and is expected to increase 37 percent by 2026. As a PA, I would be able to choose a specialization and change it as well throughout my career. I want to become a PA because I want to diagnose and treat patients. Specifically, I want to become a pediatric physician assistant. I love working with kids and I have had experience taking care of little kids my entire life. Being an older sister is what has inspired my career path and mentality.<br><br>

        Besides school, I have no paid job experience since I have always been a full time student. I am very concentrated in my studies and am very fortunate to not need a job at the moment. I do however plan to join various clubs and organizations throughout my college career. Since I am not living on campus, I want to get involved as much as I can with organizations that help both on and off campus. Currently, I am looking into getting involved in Rotary since I was involved in Interact during high school. I plan to participate in an extensive amount of community service as well as social clubs. This is because I want to help those in need in my community and I also want to meet new people. College is the place where you meet people who could possibly be in your life forever and I want to take full advantage of that opportunity to branch out and make friends.
